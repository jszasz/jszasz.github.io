                            <p>I recently completed an eight month co-op work term as a Junior Quality Assurance Analyst with The Co-operators. The Co-operators is a Canadian insurance company, whose headquarters is located in downtown Guelph, Ontario.</p>    
                            <p>I worked for a team on the IT side called Document Solutions. Document Solutions deals with how insurance documents are outputted from the insurance programs. Whether they be mailed to a client, or viewed online as a PDF.</p>
                            <p>This website will give you an overview of my eight months on the job including any challenges I faced, goals I tasked myself with improving upon, and the opportunities and skills I gained from my work experience. It is my goal to explain what I did on the job and the ways I was able to grow as an employee and as a student.</p>

                            <p>As you can see I am making an improvement with the amount of work it takes to create the website. I started with a basic wordpress website, then hosted my own Drupal 7 website, and now I am hosting the HTML pages for the site and editing their content. I am using this as a way to learn more technologies that I haven’t used very often.</p>

                            <p>The Co-operators Group Limited is a Canadian-owned co-operative. Through their group of companies, they offer home, auto, life, group, travel, commercial and farm insurance, as well as investment products. Their co-operative values make them a different kind of insurance company – one built on honesty, hard work and concern for the communities in which they live and work. They have received many accolades, including being ranked among the 50 Best Employers in Canada by Aon Hewitt, and the Top 50 Socially Responsible Corporations in Canada by Sustainalytics and Maclean’s magazine. As a member of the team, you are part of a big organization with a small company feel, working alongside a highly engaged group of people who are passionate about what they do.</p>
                            <p>Employees are split up between the IT side or the Business side of the company. I was personally on the Document Solutions team, which is on the IT side of the company. I spent most of my eight months working on the DS Project team, which was a group of contract employees who were hired to help test a very large project involving PDF insurance documents. The team is managed by Venkat Reddy.</p>
                            <p>Everyone on the team was very friendly and helpful. We went out for lunch to celebrate birthdays, a wedding, and when finishing major projects. We had potluck lunches and “lunch & learn” sessions where we would eat lunch and watch a presentation by another employee to learn about a new topic. Here are a few pictures from some social gatherings we had as a team:</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>In my role as a Junior Quality Assurance Analyst, I assisted with testing of major projects that all had to do with client facing documents. Whether that was a physical printed document, or a digital PDF. I also did some web testing for a new client facing website that allows clients to view their insurance information online.</p>
                            <p>Here is a list of my official duties:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assisting with system testing</li>
                                <li>Providing input to the development of acceptance test plans</li>
                                <li>Assisting in the development and maintenance of test case documentation</li>
                                <li>Documenting problems encountered in testing</li>
                                <li>Participating in verifications of implementations</li>
                                <li>Participating in walkthroughs of testing documentation</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I was at first only assisting with these tasks on behalf of the other testers on the team, but after I was fully onboarded into the roll, I was doing the exact same tasks as the other contract testers, and eventually in charge of my own test project from start to finish.</p>

                <section class="tasks section">
                    <div class="section-inner">
                        <h2 class="heading">Tasks / Roles</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>The tasks that I was assigned to changed over the eight months as projects were finished and I was moved to other work. This was intentional by my manager as it allowed me to gain experience doing other tasks that weren't necessilary part of my job description. I will list my tasks / roles in chronological order:</p>
                            <h3>Farm Project Testing</h3>
                            <p>There was a project called “The Farm Project” that was ongoing when I started working. The Farm policy system was being moved from an older system to a newer one, and this required testing of everything. PDF outputs from the old system were compared to PDF outputs from the new system, and all the data had to be the same on both.</p>
                            <p>This was where I started learning, so I would assist the other testers and ask them questions as I was working. I needed to learn the insurance business as well as our insurance system called Policy Centre. The other testers would handle everything else. They would look at business documents and create test requirements and policies that covered everything.</p>
                            <p>I would mainly be testing an old PDF vs a new PDF and logging any differences as issues for the programmers to look at. I would then check off that I tested that policy in an Excel spreadsheet that another tester had made. I would also create some test policies in Policy Centre based on another tester’s requirements, or create test clients in our database for these test policies.</p>
                            <p>I was helpful on this project as I was taking some work from the other testers, and it gave me a chance to learn how everything works without being responsible for a timeline.</p>
                            <h3>Selenium Farm Policy Automation</h3>
                            <p>This was a personal project I started while working on the Farm Project. My co-workers wanted me to improve on the previous co-op student’s work and try to make an application to automate policy creation in the Policy Centre application (which is just a web application).</p>
                            <h4>Workflow</h4>
                            <p>The program allows a non technical tester to fill out data in an excel spreadsheet (or copy and rearrange existing data), and run the program without changing any code. The program will automate the entire policy creation process for the tester, based on the data they entered in the Excel document. It will log in with the supplied credentials, and make a policy with the supplied data. The tester can then edit the policy if there is anything specific that they didn’t include in the Excel file, and then they can submit the policy. They can then use the PDF for testing. This allows the tester to focus on other things rather than making policies that are only slightly different, from scratch. They can make multiple of the same policies and then change what is needed to be different.</p>
                            <p></p>
