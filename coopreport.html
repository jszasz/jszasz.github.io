                            <p>I recently completed an eight month co-op work term as a Junior Quality Assurance Analyst with The Co-operators. The Co-operators is a Canadian insurance company, whose headquarters is located in downtown Guelph, Ontario.</p>    
                            <p>I worked for a team on the IT side called Document Solutions. Document Solutions deals with how insurance documents are outputted from the insurance programs. Whether they be mailed to a client, or viewed online as a PDF.</p>
                            <p>This website will give you an overview of my eight months on the job including any challenges I faced, goals I tasked myself with improving upon, and the opportunities and skills I gained from my work experience. It is my goal to explain what I did on the job and the ways I was able to grow as an employee and as a student.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>The Co-operators Group Limited is a Canadian-owned co-operative. Through their group of companies, they offer home, auto, life, group, travel, commercial and farm insurance, as well as investment products. Their co-operative values make them a different kind of insurance company – one built on honesty, hard work and concern for the communities in which they live and work. They have received many accolades, including being ranked among the 50 Best Employers in Canada by Aon Hewitt, and the Top 50 Socially Responsible Corporations in Canada by Sustainalytics and Maclean’s magazine. As a member of the team, you are part of a big organization with a small company feel, working alongside a highly engaged group of people who are passionate about what they do.</p>
                            <p>Employees are split up between the IT side or the Business side of the company. I was personally on the Document Solutions team, which is on the IT side of the company. I spent most of my eight months working on the DS Project team, which was a group of contract employees who were hired to help test a very large project involving PDF insurance documents. The team is managed by Venkat Reddy.</p>
                            <p>Everyone on the team was very friendly and helpful. We went out for lunch to celebrate birthdays, a wedding, and when finishing major projects. We had potluck lunches and “lunch & learn” sessions where we would eat lunch and watch a presentation by another employee to learn about a new topic. Here are a few pictures from some social gatherings we had as a team:</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>In my role as a Junior Quality Assurance Analyst, I assisted with testing of major projects that all had to do with client facing documents. Whether that was a physical printed document, or a digital PDF. I also did some web testing for a new client facing website that allows clients to view their insurance information online.</p>
                            <p>Here is a list of my official duties:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assisting with system testing</li>
                                <li>Providing input to the development of acceptance test plans</li>
                                <li>Assisting in the development and maintenance of test case documentation</li>
                                <li>Documenting problems encountered in testing</li>
                                <li>Participating in verifications of implementations</li>
                                <li>Participating in walkthroughs of testing documentation</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I was at first only assisting with these tasks on behalf of the other testers on the team, but after I was fully onboarded into the roll, I was doing the exact same tasks as the other contract testers, and eventually in charge of my own test project from start to finish.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading">Tasks / Roles</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>The tasks that I was assigned to changed over the eight months as projects were finished and I was moved to other work. This was intentional by my manager as it allowed me to gain experience doing other tasks that weren't necessilary part of my job description. I will list my tasks / roles in chronological order:</p>
                            <h3>Farm Project Testing</h3>
                            <p>There was a project called “The Farm Project” that was ongoing when I started working. The Farm policy system was being moved from an older system to a newer one, and this required testing of everything. PDF outputs from the old system were compared to PDF outputs from the new system, and all the data had to be the same on both.</p>
                            <p>This was where I started learning, so I would assist the other testers and ask them questions as I was working. I needed to learn the insurance business as well as our insurance system called Policy Centre. The other testers would handle everything else. They would look at business documents and create test requirements and policies that covered everything.</p>
                            <p>I would mainly be testing an old PDF vs a new PDF and logging any differences as issues for the programmers to look at. I would then check off that I tested that policy in an Excel spreadsheet that another tester had made. I would also create some test policies in Policy Centre based on another tester’s requirements, or create test clients in our database for these test policies.</p>
                            <p>I was helpful on this project as I was taking some work from the other testers, and it gave me a chance to learn how everything works without being responsible for a timeline.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/task1.jpg" alt="Task1" width="95%" height="95%"><br>Example of a "dummy" defect that could be logged.</p>
                            <h3>Selenium Farm Policy Automation</h3>
                            <p>This was a personal project I started while working on the Farm Project. My co-workers wanted me to improve on the previous co-op student’s work and try to make an application to automate policy creation in the Policy Centre application (which is just a web application).</p>
                            <h4>Workflow</h4>
                            <p>The program allows a non technical tester to fill out data in an excel spreadsheet (or copy and rearrange existing data), and run the program without changing any code. The program will automate the entire policy creation process for the tester, based on the data they entered in the Excel document. It will log in with the supplied credentials, and make a policy with the supplied data. The tester can then edit the policy if there is anything specific that they didn’t include in the Excel file, and then they can submit the policy. They can then use the PDF for testing. This allows the tester to focus on other things rather than making policies that are only slightly different, from scratch. They can make multiple of the same policies and then change what is needed to be different.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/task2.jpg" alt="Task2" width="70%" height="70%"><br>Sample of what the Excel file could look like.</p>
                            <h4>Technical</h4>
                            <p>The program was made in Java, using two main JAR’s. One is called Selenium Web Driver, which runs the web browser. The other is Apache POI, which is a Java API for Microsoft Office documents. This allows the program to access the data in the Excel file.</p>
                            <p>The program loads the data from the Excel file, and using that as its input, will start clicking and typing on the webpage. For example, an input of “100100100” might be a sequence of radio buttons, with “1” meaning yes and “0” meaning no, and the program will click on those options. Another input might be “2” which would relate to the second option in a select box. A third example might be “04/05/1980” which will be typed into a birthday input box. The program knows which data is needed depending on previous options chosen, it is basically a very complex state machine or a large set of “if” statements.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/task3.jpg" alt="Task3" width="55%" height="55%"><br>A segment of the "main" function of the Java program.</p>
                            <h4>Benefits</h4>
                            <p>This program cuts down on time for senior testers, and was used as a prototype to spotlight this technology for other uses. One of the other co-op students, that still has four months left at Co-operators, used this technology to make a free broken link checker. I also shared my work with at least 3 other testers who are going to take my work and improve upon it together.</p>
                            <h3>Co-op Student Hiring</h3>
                            <p>A non-technical task that I assisted my manager with was doing hiring work for other co-op students. I was tasked with short listing all the applicants by their resumes, booking interviews, recording information in the interview as well as asking about half of the questions, and interfacing with Recruit Guelph to successfully hire an applicant.</p>
                            <p>I shortlisted at least 50 applications in total, with about 15 interviews, with 4 co-op students being hired over the eight months. Three students started in S16 semester (with two of them still working till December 2016), and one student just started in F16.</p>
                            <p>Along with this, I compiled a co-op student hiring template that had questions my manager wanted to ask as well as some of my own. We then used that template for all of the interviews. It helped to make sure we asked all the right basic questions.</p>
                            <p>It was a change to be on the other side of the table, and I learned a lot about what a sucessful resume looks like, and how to act in interviews. It also helped with my communication skills.</p>

                            <h3>Resource Planning Spreadsheet</h3>
                            <p>This is a side project I worked on for a Director during some downtime from other work. His team was having difficulties organizing what team resources (people) were on projects and which had nothing assigned to them, both at the present and in the future for planning purposes. So, I made an Excel spreadsheet that organizes their busy time and shows when they are free to be added to projects. Ever since I created this, their team has used it at least once a week and during meetings.</p>
                            <p>It uses some simple Excel macros to automatically add up time in different projects and display it on the chart, along with automatic colouring.</p>
                            <p>Before I left, I edited this spreadsheet so that the Director has a blank spreadsheet to use for next year along with next year's dates already inputted.</p>

                            <h3>Release 36.5 Messagepoint Upgrade Testing</h3>
                            <p>This project was smaller in comparison to other test projects, but it was different as I was the lead tester on the project. The project involved upgrading one of our vendor products that takes our XML data files from our system and turns them into PDF’s. Since I was the test lead, I was responsible for creating all of the test planning documents and weekly status updates. I was exposed to a lot more project management processes than I was used to.</p>
                            <p>It took two weeks of testing from start to finish during the upgrade, and most of it was very repetitive. I would run the XML data files in the current version of the software, then run the same file in the new version of the software. After that I would need to compare for any differences. After that phase, I re-ran all the data files in the upgraded system in an “End to End” test. Meaning it was connected to our entire system, not just the vendor’s software.</p>
                            <p>It was very taxing on me to be the test lead of this project. I was constantly trying to estimate how much work I had done in what period of time, and use that estimate to see how much work I still had to do. I used this to update the Project Manager on my progress during meetings. I was always trying to work as fast as I could just to get ahead.</p>
                            <p>It was nice to get some independance, and act more like a normal tester rather than a co-op student.</p>

                            <h3>Online Services Testing</h3>
                            <p>This was the last project I was assigned to, and I only worked on it for three weeks. I was tasked with re-testing the new online services website, which allows clients to access their insurance information online. I tested the website on PC, Mac, iPhone, Nexus Phone, Samsung Tablet, and an older Android phone. I tested many things to see if I could find anything broken. I did not have a set testing schedule, so I used my testing knowledge to try and break it anyway I could. </p>
                            <p>For example, some tests:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Once registered with an email address, test to make sure I can’t register with the same email address again.</li>
                                <li>Check responsiveness of the website by testing on all the different device sizes.</li>
                                <li>Test some workflows and that all the features work.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I had prior experience with this kind of testing, so I enjoyed the work, even though I didn’t learn that much while doing it.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading">Learning Goals</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>I had three learning goals for the eight month work term that I wanted to improve on to help me in my future career. These goals can roughly apply to any co-op student, and should be taken into consideration to gain the most from a co-op term. Here is a summary of the goals that I improved upon the most, and will continue to improve upon before I graduate:</p>
                            <h3>Goal 1 - Increase Programming Experience</h3>
                            <p>I wanted to improve upon my programming experience, and have at least one thing I could add to my resume that was programming related. I did get my hands on a few technologies at Co-operators, as well as working in a Windows based workspace (where as usually we work in UNIX based systems in school). This goal was hard to accomplish fully as outside of work I was unmotivated to work on some personal coding projects, but I did still get some resume experience with my Farm Policy Automation program I made. I will have to continue working on this goal before I graduate, to help improve upon my resume and portfolio.</p>
                            <h3>Goal 2 - Better Network Myself To Future Employers</h3>
                            <p>I wanted to learn as much as I could about networking, and help prepare myself for my future full time job search. I helped my manager with interviews which gave me a different perspective on the hiring process, which gave me an insight into what is important to include on my resume. I also created a Linkedin profile and added all of my work experience to it. I added most of my current co-workers, and a good chunk of previous co-workers. Now that my resume is online, I am making a online website so that I also have a web presence with links to some projects. I will need to improve upon my portfolio before I graduate, and constantly update my website and linkedin profile. These are great things to have for potential employers to see.</p>
                            <h3>Goal 3 - Learn Insurance Business and Professional Skills</h3>
                            <p>I can personally feel the benefits from the first part of this learning goal as I am now fluent in insurance terms and the reasoning behind why certain things make insurance cheaper or more expensive. I have personally been with The Co-operators my entire life, and my advisor knows I did a co-op with the company. I feel more confident that I can read my insurance documents and that I understand what they mean. I also look forward to future conversations with my insurance advisor where we are both speaking the same language.</p>
                            <p>I also gained experience with project planning aspects of my job as I had to understand the projects that I was working on. I also had the chance to make two project testing documents detailing the testing effort for the project. The first project went on hold till next year, but the second project I was the lead tester for, so I experienced the project planning aspects first hand as I made the planning documents, presented them, carried out the testing, and made timeliness and sent out updates on progress and detailed any issues found.</p>
                            <p>It was very enriching to be in charge of my own project in the later half of my co-op term, as I feel it helped my organization skills and my time management skills, as everything that happened on the project would come back to me if something was wrong. I believe I successfully improved on this learning goal.</p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>This work term was a great experience because I felt I learned more business work experience and how projects are managed from start to finish. I found it rewarding that I knew that these documents would be seen by all of The Co-operators clients, as well as myself, as I am personally with The Co-operators for all of my insurance needs. I was able to put a little bit of all of my skills to use, and many of them had an opportunity to grow, such as teamwork, testing, problem solving, and leadership skills. The different challenges that I had allowed me to meet many of the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the semester, and I am thankful for the opportunity to work for The Co-operators.</p>
                            <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
                            <p>I would like to thank Venkat Reddy (my manager) and his team for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to work for him over the last eight months. He placed a high degree of trust in my skills and dedication, and for that I am incredibly grateful.</p>
                            <p>I would also like to thank Laura Gatto for helping me to network with The Co-operators in order to receive an interview for this position.</p>
